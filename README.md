# THIS.ME  
**This.Me** is a data-structured identity.
<img src="https://suign.github.io/assets/imgs/point.png" alt="Me" width="144"> Consider **.me** as a point.

1. ### **Install `this.me`:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `this.me` package:
   ```js
   npm install this.me
   ```
   
2. ### **Import `Me` in Your Project:**
   In the JavaScript file where you want to use `this.me`, import the `Me` class.
   ```js
   import Me from 'this.me';
   ```
   
   **Explanation**
   ​	•	The **be** method in the **Me** class accepts an object of **key-value pairs** and **adds these to the identity object**.
   ​	•	You can call **me.be()** multiple times with different attributes to dynamically update the identity object.
   
   ```javascript
   // Create a new Me instance
   let me = new Me("xyxyxy");
   
   // Add attributes to the identity
   me.be({ a: "XXX", b: "YYY" });
   me.be({ c: "z" });
   ```

**A less abstract example:**

```js
// Add attributes to the identity
me.be({ name: "Alice", phone: "33550000" });
```

**1. Registry as a Service:**

• The registry becomes a centralized service hosted by an authority (e.g., neurons.me).

• This service would handle the verification and management of all Me instances across the network.

**Example Flow:**

1. **Setup**: A developer installs this.me and configures it to connect to neurons.me.

2. **User Registration**: Users register their Me identity through the service, and the library connects to the neurons.me registry for verification.

3. **Service Interaction**: When a user interacts with a service that uses this.me, the service can trust the identity by querying the selected registry.

**Implementation:**

```js
import Me from 'this.me';
const config = {
  registryURL: 'https://registry.neurons.me', // Registry authority URL
};
let me = new Me('alice', config);
me.register({ password: 'securePass123', email: 'alice@example.com' });
// Verify and interact with services using the connected registry
```

### Neural Networks - **One-Hot Encoding**
--------
To represent the combinations of **“me, you, him, her, it, us, them”** in a neural network, we need to convert the elements into a suitable format for neural network processing, such as one-hot encoding, and design a neural network architecture that can process these inputs.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:
1.	**One-Hot Encoding:** Convert each element (“me”, “you”, “him”, “her”, “it”, “us”, “them”) into a one-hot encoded vector.
2.	**Combination Representation:** Create input vectors for each combination by combining the one-hot encoded vectors.
3.	**Neural Network Design:** Design a simple neural network to process these input vectors.

#### Step 1: One-Hot Encoding
One-hot encoding represents each element as a binary vector with a single high (1) value and the rest low (0). For the elements “me”, “you”, “him”, “her”, “it”, “us”, “them”, we can assign the following one-hot encoded vectors:

```js
// Create Me instances
const meInstance = new Me('me');
const youInstance = new Me('you');
const himInstance = new Me('him');
const herInstance = new Me('her');
const itInstance = new Me('it');
const usInstance = new Me('us');
const themInstance = new Me('them');

// One-hot encoding representation
const subjects = {
  'me': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  'you': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  'him': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  'her': [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  'it': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  'us': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  'them': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
};
```

#### Step 2: Combination Representation
For each combination, we can create an input vector by combining the one-hot encoded vectors of its elements. For example:
Combination “me, you” would be represented as the sum of the one-hot vectors for “me” and “you”:

```
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
