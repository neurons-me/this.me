## A Declarative Language  
Minimal, expressive and infinite.
Everything emerges from two primitives:

```text
Declare meaning
Resolve meaning
```

---

## 🧬 Self-Semantic Runtime Invariance
The runtime of `.me` is written **in the same semantic model that it interprets**, making it a *self-describing* and *self-sustaining* identity system.  
This property is known as **Self‑Semantic Runtime Invariance**.

### Why this matters
- The language can describe itself using its own primitives.  
- The runtime’s behavior is encoded in the same declarative structures users write.  
- Every semantic operation becomes both:
  - a computation, and  
  - a piece of meaning inside the identity universe.  
- The system is *reflexive*: the runtime can observe, narrate, and export its own evolution.

# **▵ The Philosophy**

\> ***\*Human owns meaning. Everything else asks.\****

A semantic language for identity, built from recursive declarations and symbolic paths.

`me` is ▵ ***\*meaning\**** ▵ ***\*identities\**** ▵ ***\*universes\****.

With one primitive:

> me

What ***\*.me\**** unlocks is: 

**True ownership of your identity**. 

Not through passwords, dashboards, cookie banners, or corporate **“trust us”** slogans — but **through architecture**. 

Your identity is **derived**, meaning it only exists when **you** decide to bring it into existence.
