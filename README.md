# THIS.ME  
**This.Me** is a data-structured identity.
<img src="https://suign.github.io/assets/imgs/point.png" alt="Me" width="144"> Consider **.me** as a point.

this.me is designed to generate and manage identities. It's responsible for creating identities and attributes.

1. ### **Install `this.me`:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `this.me` package:
   ```js
   npm install this.me
   ```
   
2. ### **Import `Me` in Your Project:**
   In the JavaScript file where you want to use `this.me`, import the `Me` class.
   ```js
   import Me from 'this.me';
   ```
   
   **Explanation**
   ​	•	The **be** method in the **Me** class accepts an object of **key-value pairs** and **adds these to the identity object**.
   ​	•	You can call **me.be()** multiple times with different attributes to dynamically update the identity object.
   
   ```javascript
   // Create a new Me instance
   let me = new Me("xyxyxy");
   
   // Add attributes to the identity
   me.be({ a: "XXX", b: "YYY" });
   me.be({ c: "z" });
   ```

**A less abstract example:**

```js
// Add attributes to the identity
me.be({ name: "Alice", phone: "33550000" });
```

**1. Registry as a Service:**
• The registry becomes a centralized service hosted by an authority (e.g., neurons.me).
• This service would handle the verification and management of all Me instances across the network.

**Example Flow:**
1. **Setup**: A developer installs this.me and configures it to connect to neurons.me.
2. **User Registration**: Users register their Me identity through the service, and the library connects to the neurons.me registry for verification.
3. **Service Interaction**: When a user interacts with a service that uses this.me, the service can trust the identity by querying the selected registry.

**Implementation:**
```js
import Me from 'this.me';
const config = {
  registryURL: 'https://registry.neurons.me', // Registry authority URL
};
let me = new Me('alice', config);
me.register({ password: 'securePass123', email: 'alice@example.com' });
// Verify and interact with services using the connected registry
```
