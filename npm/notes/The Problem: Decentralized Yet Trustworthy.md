The Problem: Decentralized Yet Trustworthy
Identity, by its nature, is both personal and relational. On the one hand, we want the freedom to define ourselves without external constraints. On the other, our identities must often be validated by trusted authorities to engage in meaningful transactions, whether signing a digital contract or interacting with a service.

Traditional centralized systems — such as social media platforms, government IDs, or corporate logins — often prioritize control over freedom. These systems require users to surrender their data and identities to be recognized. While decentralized technologies like blockchains have emerged to challenge this model, they introduce their own complexities and limitations, such as over-reliance on cryptographic keys or lack of intuitive identity frameworks.

The question arises:How can we create an identity system that respects personal sovereignty while ensuring trust and usability in a networked world?

Enter This.me: A New Paradigm for Identity
This.me offers a framework for identity creation and interaction that revolves around two core principles:

1. Freedom to Declare: Anyone can create a `.me` instance and define their identity without external permissions. This identity exists as a standalone object, enabling users to interact in a purely self-declared state.

2. Trust Anchors: When needed, central authorities or networks, such as Cleaker, can validate the identity. These authorities provide the infrastructure for authentication, signing, and verification without compromising the user’s control over their identity.
