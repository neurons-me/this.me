# **.me Engine: Scaling Intelligence to O(k) Complexity**
###### Core Architecture
**Infinite Semantic Proxy with Incremental Dependency Graph**

## Executive Summary
The `.me` Kernel is a deterministic, declarative state engine that bridges the gap between unstructured semantic data and high-performance reactive logic.
By replacing global re-renders with a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of dependencies, the kernel achieves **O(k)** update complexity, where:

- `k` = number of affected nodes
- Independent of total dataset size `n`

---

# 1. Computational Performance — From O(n) to O(k)
Traditional state managers (and early `.me` prototypes) relied on **broadcast logic**.
To update a fleet of 1,200 trucks, the system iterated through every member.
### Legacy Approach — O(n)
Changing one global variable forced a full scan of the collection.
### Kernel v1.0 Approach — O(k)
#### Phase 8 — Dependency Mapping
Upon formula assignment (`=`), the kernel:
1. Parses the expression
2. Builds an **Inverted Index**:

```
source_path -> [target_paths]
```

#### Targeted Invalidation
When a leaf (e.g., `fuel_price`) changes:
- The kernel queries the inverted index
- Only re-executes formulas subscribed to that leaf
### Benchmark
In a 1,200-node stress test:
- Global setup: ~10 seconds
- Local mutation resolution: **< 15 ms**

# 2. The Execution Engine — Hermetic Sandbox (Phase C)
To ensure absolute security and determinism, the kernel uses a custom-built **Arithmetic / Logic Evaluator**, replacing unsafe `eval()` and `new Function()` patterns.

### Evaluation Pipeline
```
Tokenize → Shunting-yard → RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)
```
### Safety Model
The engine is physically incapable of executing arbitrary JavaScript.
It only recognizes a strict grammar of:
#### Operators
```
+  -  *  /  %
>  >=  <  <=  ==  !=
&&  ||  !
```

#### Resolvers
- Only allows paths validated by the Kernel’s internal `readPath()`
### Impact
- Zero surface area for injection attacks
- Deterministic execution
- Hermetic evaluation environment

# 3. Observability & Forensic Traceability
The kernel implements **Native Provenance**.
Every derived value is not merely a result — it is a traceable conclusion.
### `me.explain(path)`
Returns a full derivation tree.
### Stealth-Root Integration
The kernel distinguishes between:
- Public origins
- Stealth origins
Secrets (Phase 0):
- Participate in calculations
- Appear masked (`●●●●`) in traces
### Result: Auditable Privacy
You can prove how a number was calculated **without revealing sensitive keys** used in the computation.

---

# 4. Persistence & Portability (Phase 7A / 7B)
The kernel maintains a dual-plane state model:
## Semantic Plane
- Current values of all nodes
## Cryptographic Plane
- Encrypted branches
- Local noise scopes
### Atomic Snapshot
Exports the entire kernel into a single portable blob, including:
- Memory log
- Dependency definitions
- Secret scopes
### Rehydration
A new kernel instance can ingest a snapshot and resume operations with:
- Perfect behavioral equivalence
- Preserved reactivity
- Preserved secret scopes

# 5. Technical Constraints & Guarantees

## Immutability
Every state change is recorded as a **Memory**.

## Cycle Protection
The dependency engine detects and halts circular references.
Example:

```
A = B
B = A
```

## Memory Efficiency
`unregisterDerivation()` ensures:
- Deleted nodes remove their subscriptions
- Inverted index remains clean
- No memory leaks in long-running processes

# Final Verdict
The `.me` Kernel is a **High-Density Logic Container**.
It allows developers to write code as if it were a simple JSON object — while executing it as a complex, reactive, secured computational graph.
