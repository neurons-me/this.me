Model affinity as an emergent property derived from the react table.

 Here‚Äôs how it makes sense mathematically and semantically:

‚∏ª

1. #### Conceptual Mapping
	
	‚Ä¢	Every reaction (react) entry represents an interaction between an actor and a context (context_id).
	‚Ä¢	Affinity is essentially a summary metric of how much someone resonates with a context or another identity.
	‚Ä¢	Thus, affinity = f(reacts) ‚Äî it‚Äôs derived, not stored directly.

‚∏ª

2. #### Example Formula

Let‚Äôs say in your react table you have:

context_id | target | emoji | timestamp
--------------------------------------
123        | abc    | ‚ù§Ô∏è    | ...
123        | abc    | üëç    | ...
123        | abc    | üëé    | ...

You can define an affinity score like:

SELECT target,
       AVG(
           CASE emoji
                WHEN '‚ù§Ô∏è' THEN 1.0
                WHEN 'üëç' THEN 0.7
                WHEN 'üëé' THEN -1.0
                ELSE 0
           END
       ) AS affinity_score
FROM react
GROUP BY target;

This gives you a normalized affinity metric per target, context, or even per verb.

3. #### Why This Is Better
	
	‚Ä¢	You don‚Äôt need a new table like affinity.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs composable: any app using this.me can compute affinity however it wants.
	‚Ä¢	Different apps can define different scoring functions without touching the protocol.

‚∏ª

4. #### **Integration with this.me**

Later, if you want this.me to expose affinity directly, we can:
	‚Ä¢	Add a virtual view in PostgreSQL called me_affinity.
	‚Ä¢	Or add a computed resolver in GraphQL that calculates affinity on-the-fly using react.
