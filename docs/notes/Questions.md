Key Questions to Address
Identity Core: What defines the essence of .me?
Relationships: How does .me relate to others, groups, or larger entities?
Belongings: What does .me own or have as personal items?
Modularity: How do we allow external objects to seamlessly integrate with .me?
Hierarchy of Interactions: How do we classify interactions into tiers (self, relationships, society, etc.)?

### **1. Identity Core: What defines the essence of `.me`?**
   - **Essence Defined:**
     - **Immutable Core Attributes:** `username` and `DID` (Decentralized Identifier).
     - Clearly distinguishes the user's unique existence in the digital realm.
   - **Practical Implementation:**
     - Identity core is foundational and unchangeable, ensuring trust and consistency across systems.

### **2. Relationships: How does `.me` relate to others, groups, or larger entities?**
   - **Connections Defined:**
     - **Contacts:** Direct relationships (e.g., friends, acquaintances).
     - **Groups:** Collections with shared contexts (e.g., family, organizations, societies).
   - **Methods:**
     - `.relationships.addContact()` to add individual connections.
     - `.relationships.createGroup()` to organize groups dynamically.
   - **Hierarchy:**
     - Nested structures enable relationships at various tiers (e.g., groups of groups, organizations within societies).

### **3. Belongings: What does `.me` own or have as personal items?**
   - **Properties Defined:**
     - Everything the user owns or manages (e.g., wallets, devices, digital files).
   - **Methods for Ownership:**
     - `.properties.add()`, `.properties.share()`, `.properties.transferOwnership()`, `.properties.revokeAccess()`.
   - **Modular Approach:**
     - Allows external objects like `Wallet`, `Device`, or `Vehicle` to integrate without hardcoding.

### **4. Modularity: How do we allow external objects to seamlessly integrate with `.me`?**
   - **Independent Objects:**
     - Objects like `Wallet`, `Device`, etc., are designed and managed outside the `this.me` instance.
   - **Integration:**
     - These objects are registered to `this.me` via methods like `.addProperty()`.
     - They maintain their internal logic while adhering to the ownership and interaction protocols defined by `.me`.
   - **Advantages:**
     - Scalability: Easy to introduce new objects without modifying the `this.me` core.
     - Transferability: Ownership can move across `.me` instances seamlessly.

### **5. Hierarchy of Interactions: How do we classify interactions into tiers (self, relationships, society, etc.)?**
   - **Tiers of Interactions:**
     - **Reactions:** Personal engagements (`like`, `comment`, `share`).
     - **Relationships:** Broader social connections (individuals, groups, organizations).
     - **Attributes:** How `.me` defines itself (e.g., status, bio, pronouns).
     - **Properties:** Interaction with owned or managed items.
   - **Unified Structure:**
     - Centralized under `.reactions` and `.relationships`.
     - Interaction types remain modular and expandable, allowing for a hierarchy to emerge naturally through usage (e.g., personal to societal interactions).
