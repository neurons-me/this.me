This structure implies:

1. Logical Grouping of Entities: me && you && him represents a logical grouping, where each entity is included as part of a broader relationship.

2. Contextual Scoping: Context/mexicans provides a scope within which this relationship exists, giving meaning to the relationship without establishing a strict hierarchy among me, you, and him.

3. Dynamic Meaning: The meaning can change based on context. For example:

• me && you && himContext/mexicans could mean a group of entities (me, you, him) sharing a “Mexican” attribute.

Context/friends might represent the same group within a “friends” context, applying different attributes or significance.
